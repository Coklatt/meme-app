![App Screen](./src/assets/app-screenshot.png)

Simple project to create custom memes. [See it live](https://pd-meme-generator.netlify.app/).

### Under the hood

- React JS
- React Context API
- React Hooks useState, useContext, useReducer
- Styled Components
- URL interface (Web APIs)

#### Note
Still a work in progress in the very initial phase of the development so expect to see it changing, even drastically, at any time.
